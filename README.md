> A collection of intermediate/advanced data analysis and machine learning projects in R and Python

# Purpose
This repository contains data analysis and machine learning projects covering various use cases using both real and fictional datasets.

Each project is, in principle, structured as follows:
- A DDL.sql (Data Definition Language) file that clearly indicates the data fields and the
- Scripts (.R and .ipynb files) for validating, manipulating, and using the data
- A comprehensive report detailing the entire process, saved as a PDF along with a LaTeX source.
